" This variant will set up the mappings only for the *CURRENT* buffer.
lua require'snippets'.use_suggested_mappings(true)

" There are only two keybindings specified by the suggested keymappings, which is <C-k> and <C-j>
" They are exactly equivalent to:

" <c-k> will either expand the current snippet at the word or try to jump to
" the next position for the snippet.
inoremap <c-K> <cmd>lua return require'snippets'.expand_or_advance(1)<CR>

" <c-j> will jump backwards to the previous field.
" If you jump before the first field, it will cancel the snippet.
inoremap <c-J> <cmd>lua return require'snippets'.advance_snippet(-1)<CR>
